ILO Server SSH access via openwrt
=================================
login to openwrt
opkg update
opkg install openssh-client

iLO SSH server is offering only older, less secure key exchange algorithms (like diffie-hellman-group14-sha1 and diffie-hellman-group1-sha1), which are not enabled by default in newer SSH clients due to security concerns.
so use below to connect 
/usr/bin/ssh -oKexAlgorithms=diffie-hellman-group14-sha1 -oHostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-rsa artia@192.168.2.110
